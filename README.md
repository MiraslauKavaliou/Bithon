Bithon is a dynamically-typed programming language designed with the principle that "limitation breeds creativity." Inspired by Python and Assembly, Bithon aims to provide simplicity and power while encouraging innovative problem-solving through constraints. This language is a work in progress, constantly evolving to fulfill its vision.

## Features

- **Pythonic Syntax**: Bithon adopts a syntax that closely resembles Python, making it familiar and intuitive for Python developers.

- **Short Built-in Methods**: Bithon employs short 3-letter names for its built-in methods, reducing verbosity and enabling concise code.

- **Interoperability**: Bithon allows seamless integration with Python libraries, leveraging the vast ecosystem of Python packages for extended functionality.

- **Dynamic Compilation**: Bithon supports both compilation and dynamic execution, providing flexibility in how you use and distribute your code.

- **Performance Enhancement**: In the future, Bithon aims to incorporate Go language compatibility to harness its speed and performance, combining simplicity with high efficiency.

## Example Code

```ruby
prn "Prime Number Generator"

prn "Enter the upper bound:"
inp upper

prn "Prime numbers between " 0 " and " upper " are:"

lop num 1 upper
    iff is_prime num
        prn num

def is_prime num
    iff num eql 2 or num eql 3
        ret true
    iff num mod 2 eql 0 or num eql 1
        ret false
    els
        lop i 3 sqrt num 2
            iff num mod i eql 0
                ret false
        ret true

def sqrt num
    ret num pow 0.5
```

This is a sample program written in Bithon that generates prime numbers within a given range. It prompts the user to enter an upper bound and then displays all the prime numbers between 1 and the specified upper bound.

The program consists of a main function, an is_prime function, and a sqrt function. Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

- `prn "Prime Number Generator"`: This line simply prints a message indicating that the program is a Prime Number Generator.

- `prn "Enter the upper bound:"`: This prompts the user to enter the upper bound for prime number generation.

- `inp upper`: This line reads the user's input and assigns it to the variable `upper`.

- `prn "Prime numbers between " 0 " and " upper " are:"`: This line prints a message indicating the range of prime numbers to be generated, using the value of `upper`.

- `lop num 1 upper`: This is a loop that iterates through the numbers from 1 to `upper`, with the loop variable `num`.

- `iff is_prime num`: This line checks if the current value of `num` is prime by calling the `is_prime` function.

- `prn num`: If `num` is determined to be a prime number, it is printed using the `prn` statement.

- `def is_prime num`: This defines the `is_prime` function, which checks whether a given number is prime.

- `iff num eql 2 or num eql 3`: This line checks if `num` is equal to 2 or 3, which are prime numbers. If true, the function returns `true`.

- `iff num mod 2 eql 0 or num eql 1`: This line checks if `num` is divisible by 2 or equal to 1, both of which are not prime numbers. If true, the function returns `false`.

- `lop i 3 sqrt num 2`: This is a loop that iterates from 3 to the square root of `num` (inclusive) with the loop variable `i`. It checks if `num` is divisible by `i`. If true, the function returns `false`.

- `ret true`: If none of the previous conditions match, the function determines that `num` is a prime number and returns `true`.

- `def sqrt num`: This defines the `sqrt` function, which calculates the square root of a given number using the `pow` operator.

- `ret num pow 0.5`: This line returns the square root of `num` by raising it to the power of 0.5 using the `pow` operator.
